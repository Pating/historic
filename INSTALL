Installation Instructions
*************************

Run ./configure after untaring the package.

 bash# ./configure
 GlusterFS configure summary
 ===========================
 FUSE client        : yes
 Infiniband verbs   : yes
 epoll IO multiplex : yes
 Berkeley-DB        : yes
 libglusterfsclient : yes
 mod_glusterfs      : yes
 argp-standalone    : no
 
The configure summary will tell you what all components will be built with 
GlusterFS. Other than 'argp-standalone' if something else says 'no', that 
feature in GlusterFS will not be built. 'argp-standalone' package will not 
get installed if the system already has a proper argp package installed.

Now just run 'make' and later run 'make install' to install the package.

 bash# make 
 bash# make install

Installation complete :-)

 bash# glusterfs --version

Make sure your version is the latest from the release, and the one you 
just installed :-)
