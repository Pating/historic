1.  It's highly recommended to use FREE() macro to free allocated memory.
    Error when using it:
    	   lvalue required error occures when using FREE() with typecasting.
	   Example:
	   	  FREE ((void *) myptr); // gives lvalue error
		  fix is
		  FREE (myptr);

2.  It's highly recommended to declare #define names in fully Caps.

3.  Check return value of calloc(), malloc(), realloc(), alloca(), strdup() etc

4.  Always when an "open()" call is used with O_CREAT as the second argument,
    specifying the third argument "mode" is mandatory. 

5.  All Platform specific code should go under proper "$(GF_HOST_OS)" in compat.h
    to make sure there are no build errors. 

6.  Please do not use variables/function names written or might comflicting with
    the system libraries. This might have serious repurcussions during cross 
    platform porting.
